- evaluate on different metrics
- compute NDCG at 0 - 5 as simply as doing NDCG at 5
- enable hill climbing on combinaison of metrics
- once best models are known make the ensemble and compute NDCG for each step.

Orgnanize the code as such:

tools/ : contains all programs used to run shotgun
scripts/ : contains misc scripts used ina particular experiment
lib/ : contains the files used by tools
